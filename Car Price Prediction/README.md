# Concise Summary
A project utilizing hands-on Python and Machine Learning allowing users to estimate resale values of cars based upon individual condition and history.

# Objective
The objective is to get away from "guesstimating" at prices and instead generate price-based pricing based upon historical sales through a regression model that will allow us to accurately predict the market value of a vehicle.

# Project Flow
- Data Encoding - Convert text data (i.e., Diesel, Automatic, etc.) into numeric data-value that a computer can use.
- Data Splitting - Divide the data into two sets, the first set used to train the model and the second set held out as a "final test" for its accuracy against cars the model doesn't "know".
- Model Fitting - Use linear versus lasso regression methods to determine which best fits the real world pricing metrics of the Vehicle.
- Validation - Use scatter graphs to illustrate how close we were to predicting the actual sold values of the vehicles.

# Outcome
This project proves that the lasso regression approach resulted in a better fit to the data. It demonstrated how machine learning allows us to use traditional non-standardized historical listings as a reliable pricing tool for buyers/sellers.
